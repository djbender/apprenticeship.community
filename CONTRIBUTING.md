First off, *THANK YOU* for being interested in helping with the apprenticeship
community! We're flattered you consider spending your time helping build a
community of practice around business cultures of professional growth a
worthwhile use of your time!

Here are some common questions:

## Will You Treat Me Well?

Great question! We want to make you feel welcome, so we've adopted the
[Contributor Covenant](CONTRIBUTOR_COVENANT.md) as an agreement between project
maintainers and collaborators.

## How Can I Help?
The most obvious answer is you help merely by participating in the community. If
you want to do more, we're eager to hear suggestions, publish your writing, or
link to informative resources.

## What Kind of Suggestions Are You Looking For?
Whatever you think we need to hear! If you need inspiration:

* Notifications of problematic published content. (Our [code of
  conduct](http://apprenticeship.community/code-of-conduct) covers how we handle
  to problematic behavior in our community.)
* Things you'd like to read.
* Services you believe would fit well with our mission.
* Typos or grammar mistakes.
* Any kind of compassionate, specific, actionable feedback.

## How Do I Make Suggestions?
We prefer you [create an
issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) in our [issue
tracker](issues), but if you're uncomfortable with that send an email with your
suggestion to [yo+apprenticeship-community@zincma.de](mailto:
yo+apprenticeship-community@zincma.de).

## How Do I Know What To Work On?

We use [github issues](issues) and
[waffle](https://waffle.io/zincmade/apprenticeship.community) to plan what to
work on. Feel free to grab anything marked "ready", or come up with something
new and awesome!


## How Do I Submit Work?

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to handle
contributions, and use the [fork and
pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull)
collaboration model. Once you've [created a
fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) You can submit a pull
request [right from your
browser](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow-in-the-browser/)

Once you [submit a pull
request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/), we'll
review it right away!

If all that sounds scary ask for help in the community or send an email to
[yo+apprenticeship-community@zincma.de](mailto:
yo+apprenticeship-community@zincma.de) and we'll work with you to get your work
in!

# Who Are The Project's Leadership?
